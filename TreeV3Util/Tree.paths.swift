    /// is a "collection". For example, if you have `IndexPath`
    /// as your path, `[]` means root collection, not an element.
    /// `[0]` means first child collection, and not its element.
    /// You always need to use indices in the collection to locate
    /// element in a node.
    ///
    /// Element Iteration
    /// -----------------
    /// You can get elements at paths easily like this.
    ///
    ///     let e = a[p.last!, in: p.dropLast()]
    ///
    /// Note that elements in this order is not in DFS.
    /// You need to use `Tree.dfs` to get element iteration
    /// in DFS order. Also don't forget dropping first element
    /// in iteration which is `[]`, that doesn't have element.
