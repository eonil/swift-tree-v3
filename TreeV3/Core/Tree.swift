/// An interface to access elements in a tree.
///
/// - Note:
///     This is designed as a flat interface to access tree structure.
///     Therefore different with `Branch` that is designed to
///     build free-form, pointer-based tree datastructures quickly.
///     Combination of two protocols produces `BranchTree`.
///
/// - Note:
///     `Path` is intentionally an opaque type. You can configure
///     how paths would work. One possible usage is implementing
///     path look-up as key look-up in table that can be used if you
///     want to vut down tree navigational look-up cost.
///
/// No Subtree Level Operation
/// --------------------------
/// In `Tree`s, every operations must be done at element level.
/// There's no way to insert/remove "subtree" at once.
/// Anyway, implementations are free to provide "extra" ways to deal
/// with such situations.
///
/// Conform to `Tree` Protocol
/// --------------------------
/// The simplest way to conform `Tree` protocol is
/// implementing these members.
/// - `path`
/// - `path(at:,in:)`
/// - `contents(in:)`
/// There're default implementations based on these members,
/// and you don't need to override them unless you need some
/// optimization.
///
/// If you want to make trees modiftable, conform `MutableTree`
/// and `RangeReplaceableTree` too.
