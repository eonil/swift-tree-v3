/// This is a device to implement pointer-based tree structures quickly.
///
/// - Note:
///     Branches have dedicated collection for children.
///     This is intentional as the alternative design (attached value on a collection)
///     cannot satisfy `RangeReplaceableCollection`.
///
/// - Note:
///     As being homogeneous recursive tree,
///     navigating into `Branch` can be done collection of indices.
///     This is a natively supported path.
