/// An interface to access elements in a tree.
///
/// - Note:
///     This is designed as a flat interface to access tree structure.
///     Therefore different with `Branch` that is designed to
///     build free-form, pointer-based tree datastructures quickly.
///     Combination of two protocols produces `BranchTree`.
///
/// - Note:
///     `Path` is intentionally an opaque type. You can configure
///     how paths would work. One possible usage is implementing
///     path look-up as key look-up in table that can be used if you
///     want to vut down tree navigational look-up cost.
