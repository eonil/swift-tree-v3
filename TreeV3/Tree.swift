/// A collection that organizes internal elements in tree-shape.

/// - Note:
///     This is designed as a flat interface to access tree structure.
///     Therefore different type with `Tree` and `Branch` that are designed to
///     build free-form, pointer-based tree datastructures quickly.
///     An implementation can conform both of `TreeCollection` and `Tree`
///     for convenience in both of storage and access.
